        "ans": "Utmost care is taken to collect samples while maintaining complete hygiene. Only new and fresh collection kits and needles are used. After collection, the sample is immediately transferred into an icebox to prevent degradation and bacterial build-up which may lead to inaccurate diagnosis. The samples are barcode tagged to prevent mix up and in the laboratories, technicians use high-end, state-of-the-art devices to analyse the samples."

        "ques": "Why are lab tests essential?",
        "ans": "Lab tests or diagnostic tests are recommended by doctors when they suspect that there might be something wrong with your health. Samples of your blood, stool, urine, or mucus can reveal a lot about the state of your health when analysed with special devices. Once the problem is detected, your doctor can diagnose and put you on medication or suggest a course of treatment."

        "ans": "The reports that our labs will deliver to you will be quite detailed. There will be charts of reference ranges to help you understand the report and a statement from a qualified doctor. But, once you receive your report, it is best to consult your doctor and ask him/her to explain it to you."

        "ques":"If the lab test results are within normal range, does that mean no illness has been detected?" ,
        "ans": "If your reports are within normal range, it is certainly good news. But normal results do not always give you a clean bill of health. If symptoms persist, your doctor will recommend other tests to detect what is triggering the unusual signs."
